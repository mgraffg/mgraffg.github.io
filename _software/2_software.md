description: A Baseline for Multilingual Sentiment Analysis

b4msa is multilingual framework, that can be served as a baseline for sentiment analysis classifiers, as well as a starting point to build new sentiment analysis systems.

b4msa extends our work on creating a text classifier (see $\mu$TC) by incorporating different language dependent techniques such as:

* Stemming
* Stopword
* Negations
