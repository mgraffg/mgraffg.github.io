Twitter is perhaps one of the social media more amenable for research. However, knowing which events are expressed on Twitter is a challenging task.  

This project aims to develop algorithms to do exploratory data analysis on a collection of word and bigram frequencies stored in  the library described in [A Python library for exploratory data analysis on twitter data based on tokens and aggregated originâ€“destination information](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0098300421002946)

The exploratory data analysis is directed to retrieve the events that occur in a day using a word cloud as a visualization technique and building blocks the frequencies of words and bigrams in the day of interest and other days stored in the library.
